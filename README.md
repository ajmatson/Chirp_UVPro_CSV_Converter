# Chirp_UVPro_CSV_Converter
This repo was created to share a set of python and php code that allows the output of Chirp Radio Programmer files in .csv format and convert them to the format that the BTECH/HT applicaiton recognizes with the correct headers, etc. Feel free to pull and recommend changes to the code with proper attributionn since no other code/app exists currently to perform this task and it takes a lot of personal time to provdie this. If you would like to support us and help us grop we only ask you visit our social media and our YouTube channel and subscribe so we can put more time to this and other projects.
